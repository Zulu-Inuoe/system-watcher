* System watcher

A tool that let's you continually run your tests in a terminal while
you code. Saving a file that belongs to the system you're working on
will automatically trigger a reload (from source) and test run.

Use it like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ./system-watcher-sbcl-loop --test-function "my-system/tests:run-tests" my-system my-system/tests [ other systems to watch ]
#+END_SRC

If the ~--test-function~ option is specified, then it should name a
function defined to call ~(fiveam:run! 'mysystem::all-tests)~ or
something similar.

You may copy system-watcher-sbcl and system-watcher-sbcl-loop to =~/bin=
if you like.

If your project has massive dependencies, you can specify ~--core t~
(or ~--core name-of-core~) which will save a core that you should use
like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ while my-app-system-watcher.core ; do true ; done
#+END_SRC

This will cut down on reload time.

This tool depends on https://github.com/pve1/shell-utility. The rest
is in quicklisp.
